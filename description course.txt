Advanced Computer Vision with TensorFlow

About course :
a) Explore image classification, image segmentation, object localization, and object detection. 
	Apply transfer learning to object localization and detection.
b) Apply object detection models such as regional-CNN and ResNet-50, customize existing models,
 and build your own models to detect, localize, and label your own rubber duck images.
c) Implement image segmentation using variations of the fully convolutional network (FCN) including U-Net and
     Mask-RCNN to identify and detect numbers, pets, zombies, and more.
d) Identify which parts of an image are being used by your model to make its predictions using class
   activation maps and saliency maps and apply these ML interpretation methods to inspect and improve the design of a famous network, AlexNet.
